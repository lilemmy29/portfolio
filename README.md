### Projects
#### 1. Thyroid-Cancer-Prediction-Model
Predicting the recurrence of well-differentiated thyroid cancer is the focus of this machine learning project. Leveraging a dataset with 13 clinicopathologic features spanning 15 years, the model development adheres to ethical considerations, ensuring data integrity. With an initial exploration, removal of duplicates, and necessary preprocessing, the Random Forest Classifier is trained on a carefully split dataset. Optimization via RandomizedSearchCV fine-tunes the model, leading to robust performance. Evaluation metrics showcase the model's efficacy, with a notable F1 score of 0.8985 on the test set. In conclusion, this project successfully delivers a reliable predictive tool for thyroid cancer recurrence, laying the groundwork for future refinements and real-world validations.

#### 2. NEW-YORK-HOUSING-ANALYSIS
Uncover the nuances of the New York Housing Market through a powerful regression model. This analysis, based on a Kaggle dataset, illuminates key factors influencing property prices. With an impressive R-squared of 0.986, the model reveals insights into bedrooms, bathrooms, and square footage. Explore the Jupyter Notebook for a concise overview of this impactful project, offering valuable insights for investors and homebuyers alike.
